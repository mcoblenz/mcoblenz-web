I study how to design programming languages to improve developers' productivity. In doing so, I developed PLIERS {% cite Coblenz2021:PLIERS %} (Programming Language Iterative Evaluation and Refinement System), which is a method of integrating user-centered design into the process of designing programming languages. I use this approach to create concrete programming languages and then evaluate how the new languages affect people's ability to write software. For example, I created [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian-lang.org/), a new smart contract language that uses a strong type system to rule out critical classes of bugs at compile time. 

I completed my Ph.D. in the [Computer Science Department](http://csd.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I was a student of [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) and [Brad A. Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/). I also collaborated closely with [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). Then, I was a Basili postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland. I worked with [Michael Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/), [Michelle Mazurek](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/), and [Adam Porter](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/aporter/).

Before that, I spent eight years as a full-time software engineer on the iWork team at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/), focusing on [Numbers](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/). I worked on versions for macOS, iOS, and iCloud. If you're still using some other spreadsheet app, give Numbers a try!

For reference, I have posted my materials for my job search in 2022: [CV](assets/pdf/CV-jobsearch.pdf), [research statement](assets/pdf/research.pdf), [teaching statement](assets/pdf/teaching.pdf), and [diversity, equity, and inclusion statement](assets/pdf/diversity.pdf).
