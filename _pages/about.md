**I am recruiting PhD students this application cycle.** [Applications](https://connect.grad.ucsd.edu/apply/) are due December 21, 2022. I'm looking for prospective students who want to change the world by making it easier for many kinds of programmers and software engineers to create high-quality software at lower cost. I'm also interested in applying the principles of human-computer interaction, software engineering, and programming languages to help address the climate crisis. Can we build tools to make climate scientists' jobs easier? Can we create formal tools to help policymakers to develop and enforce policies that make the world a better place?

 I created PLIERS {% cite Coblenz2021:PLIERS %} (Programming Language Iterative Evaluation and Refinement System), which is a method of integrating user-centered design into the process of designing programming languages. I use this approach to create concrete programming languages and then evaluate how the new languages affect people's ability to write software. For example, I created [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian-lang.org/), a new smart contract language that uses a strong type system to rule out critical classes of bugs at compile time. 

I completed my Ph.D. in the [Computer Science Department](http://csd.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I was a student of [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) and [Brad A. Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/). I also collaborated closely with [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). Then, I was a Basili postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland. I worked with [Michael Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/), [Michelle Mazurek](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/), and [Adam Porter](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/aporter/).

Before that, I spent eight years as a full-time software engineer on the iWork team at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/), focusing on [Numbers](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/). I worked on versions for macOS, iOS, and iCloud. If you're still using some other spreadsheet app, give Numbers a try!

For reference, I have posted my materials for my job search in 2022: [CV](assets/pdf/CV-jobsearch.pdf), [research statement](assets/pdf/research.pdf), [teaching statement](assets/pdf/teaching.pdf), and [diversity, equity, and inclusion statement](assets/pdf/diversity.pdf).
