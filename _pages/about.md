I study how to design programming languages to improve developers' productivity. In doing so, I developed PLIERS {% cite Coblenz2021:PLIERS %} (Programming Language Iterative Evaluation and Refinement System), which is a method of integrating user-centered design into the process of designing programming languages. I use this approach to create concrete programming languages and then evaluate how the new languages affect people's ability to write software. For example, I created [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian-lang.org/), a new smart contract language that uses a strong type system to rule out critical classes of bugs at compile time. 

I completed my Ph.D. in the [Computer Science Department](http://csd.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I was a student of [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) and [Brad A. Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/). I also collaborated closely with [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). Now, I'm a Basili postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland. I work with [Michael Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/), [Michelle Mazurek](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/), and [Adam Porter](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/aporter/).

I spent ten years at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/). For eight years, I was a full-time software engineer on the iWork team, focusing on [Numbers](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/). I worked on versions for macOS, iOS, and iCloud. If you're still using some other spreadsheet app, give Numbers a try!

I am on the 2022 academic job market! For convenience, I have posted my [CV](assets/CV.pdf), [research statement](assets/research.pdf), [teaching statement](assets/teaching.pdf), and [diversity, equity, and inclusion statement](assets/diversity.pdf).
