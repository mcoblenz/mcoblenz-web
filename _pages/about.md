I study how to design programming languages to improve developers' productivity. I am developing new principles for language design that let language designers make informed choices regarding how their language design ecisions will affect the users of their languages. I work with [Michael Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/) and [Adam Porter](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/aporter/).

I completed my Ph.D. in the [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/) [Computer Science Department](http://csd.cmu.edu). I was a student of [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) and [Brad A. Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/). I also collaborated closely with [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). 

I spent ten years at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/), where I was a software engineer on the iWork team, focusing on [Numbers](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/). I worked on versions for macOS, iOS, and iCloud. If you're still using some other spreadsheet app, give Numbers a try!
